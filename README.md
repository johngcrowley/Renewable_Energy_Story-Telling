# Renewable_Energy_Story-Telling
Wrangling, merging, analyzing World Bank / Renewable Energy data to see the relationships of different economies across the globe.

## Data Visualization: World Bank + Renewable Energy Analysis
## By: John G. Crowley
#### I took a project I completed for the University of Michigan Applied Data Science course, and expanded it to include more indepth visualizations and data story-telling. I wanted to see:

- Was there a more efficient and functional way to wrangle the data than before?
- How did countries compare to each other based on their 1. Size, 2. Renewable Energy %, 3. GDP rankings
- I wanted to explore the trade-off between a big economy and a renewable one. Or if one needs high GDP to change.
